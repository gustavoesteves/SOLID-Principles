# SOLID Principles

## Dependency Inversion (DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle)
The goal of the dependency inversion pattern is to avoid this highly coupled distribution with the mediation of an abstract layer, and to increase the re-usability of higher/policy layers.
The principle states:
 - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
 - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
