# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsability

Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality. That responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
Motivations:

- Maintainability
- Testability
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Parallel Development
- Loose Coupling
